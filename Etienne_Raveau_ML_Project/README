Guide for the project:

You will find in the folder everything that has been used for the project: Python codes, figures and tables created and a report explaining the methodology and discussing the findings.

If you want, the python codes could be runned to print results with the best algorithms and parameters chosen.
Moreover, some indicators could be printed such as the time completion and the result of the scoring method, one just needs to uncomment the related lines.
There are two files : one for the single label classification and the other for the multi label classification.
Every explanation needed to understand the code should by into the python files, as steps have been described one by one.
Further explanation may be provided by reading the project report.
Finally, I left some testing code in the file related to multi label classification.
If you like, you can take a look at it to see how I tinkered with algorithms to measure and compare their performances.

Hope you will like it !
